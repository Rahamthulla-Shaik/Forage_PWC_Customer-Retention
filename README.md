# Forage_PWC_Customer-Retention
  A few weeks after presenting your dashboard, the Retention Manager from the telecom company reaches out, impressed by your work. He requests a dashboard focused on customer 
  retention.
  
  The telecom Retention Manager has also scheduled a meeting with the PwC engagement partner to discuss the following points:

  Customer Retention is Key: Keeping customers is crucial for our business, and we donâ€™t want to lose them.

  Retention Department Role: Our team aims to win back customers who have terminated their contracts.

  Proactive Approach Needed: Currently, we contact customers only after termination, which is reactive. We need to identify at-risk customers before they leave.

  Challenges with Excel: Past customer analyses using Excel have been ineffective and led to dead-ends.

  Clear Visualizations: We need clear and self-explanatory visualizations of customer data for our management team.
